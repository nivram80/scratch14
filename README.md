# Scratchtown Brewing Website
Welcome to Scratchtown Brewing Company’s website.  The website is a **Sinatra** application that integrates Twitter and MailChimp.  I chose to use **Ruby** and Sinatra, rather than Wordpress or Jekyll, because I plan on creating a **CMS** for the brewing company so they can add content whenever they would like to.  Also, I have plans to implement a **e-commerce** feature so customers can order beer and merchandise through the site.  As a matter of fact, I will probably recreate the site using **Rails** when that time comes.

## Front-end
I utilized **Foundation 5’s** top-bar navigation feature and grid system to make the site responsive.  Foundation allowed me to quickly implement a small, medium, and large version of the site so it will look good on all devices.  The **CSS** isn’t whatever came with Foundation.  I created my own styling code and tried to make it look unique.
